/**
 * Problem: Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
 * Description: Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
 *
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
